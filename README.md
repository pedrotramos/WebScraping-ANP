# Scraping ANP's Oil & Gas Data with Selenium

A company participating in Petrobras' divestment processes asked me to obtain the historical production data of a series of mature fields, some of which have more than 1000 wells and have been explored since the 80s. The data is publicly available in <a href="https://www.gov.br/anp/">ANP's website</a> but is not downloadable, thus the need to use <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a>.

In order to use this project, it's important to set which fields should be scraped in the fields.txt file. Additionally, the user needs to <a href="https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads">download the Chrome Driver</a> compatible with the version of Google Chrome installed in the machine used. Finally, just run the Python script and wait for the extraction to be completed. The output is a group of Excel files containing the data obtained.

**Disclaimer:** The spreadsheets in this repository are just examples of the output generated by the script. None of them have anything to do with the fields that the company wanted to analyze. Additionally, the Power BI page containing the data is constantly changing, therefore this script might not be updated to deal with the structure currently being used by ANP.
